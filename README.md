## TypeScript definitions for Spelunky 2 lua scripts

Use with [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/)

Declarations in the file `spel2_declarations.d.ts`, I will look how to share this as npm package later

## Notes:
For classes with constructor like AABB and Color, use .new() instead of new
